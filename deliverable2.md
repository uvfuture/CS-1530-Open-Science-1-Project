## CS 1530 - SPRINT 2 DELIVERABLE


### What We Accomplished
We continued using Slack as our primary means of communication. We also had weekly meeetings and scheduled them such that everyone had a chance to attend at least once. Slack is working well for our team because everyone can see whats going on and can easily talk with each other. The customer is also park of the Slack channel and we can easilty communcate with them to clear up any doubt we have have. For example, one of ur group members suggested using the Mithril JavaScript framework. Unsure if this would be allowed, we were easily able to get in contact with the technical contact, Suchandra, and clear up the issue.
