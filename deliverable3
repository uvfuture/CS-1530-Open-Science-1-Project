# Why we chose those User Stories


# Customer Feedback
To demo the project to the customer and get their feedback, we requested a meeting with Dr. Krieger. Dr. Krieger was out of town, but available for a conference call. We used a service called UberConference, recommended by Suchandra, to have the conference call. This allowed several of our team members as well as Dr. Krieger and Suchandra to get together and discuss the project. We used UberConference's screen sharing feature to run a demo of what we have so far. Initial response was positive. Right now, our website's interface is very simple, which Dr. Krieger liked. He did have some additional feature requests. He wanted to add a toggle for 1 or multiple processors. He also want us to add the ability to allow for multiple files to be uploaded simultaneously at some point in the future. We also cleared up the issue regarding user registration. For now, we will implement the ability for users to register, and it will be independent from OSG Connect accounts.

Overall, the meeting was a success. We were able to get the feedback we were looking for. We also now know we're on the right track. Suchandra is going to provide details on how we can get our backend connected to the OSG middleware.
